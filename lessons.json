{"Lesson Title":"Probability", "Lesson Content":"Probability:\n        - Probability is the likelihood of an event occurring given a sample space of equally likely outcomes.\nThis is defined as P(E) =  |E|/|S| (E being the even and S being the sample space).\nWhile the probability of something not happening is P(¬E) = 1 - P(E).\n\nExample1 \nIf we roll a pair of six-sided dice once, what is the probability that the total is 6? \nPossible outcomes:\n(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6)\n(2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6)\n3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6)\n(4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6)\n(4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6)\n(6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6)\n The probability is 5/36 \n\n    Sample Space:\n        - An event is a subset of a sample space.\nFor example the set for the event of rolling at least a 3 when rolling a 6 sided dice is {3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\n    Sum Rule:\n        - The sum rule is a method of working out the probability of any of multiple events occurring.\nFor example for event A or B happening the sum rule is defined as: P(A∪B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A∩B).\nWhile conversely the probability for disjoint sets is defined as: P(A∩B) = P(A) + P(B).\n\n    Conditional Probability:\n        - Conditional probability is the probability of an event given that another event occurs.\nFor example for events A and B it is defined as (A|B) = P(A∩B)/P(B). \n\nExample2 \nIf we roll a pair of six-sided dice once, what is the probability that the total is greater than 6 given at least one of the dice is greater than 3?\nPossible outcomes: \n(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6)\n(2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6)\n3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6)\n(4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6)\n(4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6)\n(6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6)\nSolution:  P(A ∩ B) = P(A|B) * P(B) = 21/36  /  27/36 = 7/9 = 0.7778"} ,
  {"Lesson Title":"Sets", "Lesson Content":"Sets Lesson:\n\n    Sets Notation:\n        - (A∪B) denotes the union of two sets which is the elements of both sets together.\nFor example (A∪B) with A = {1, 2} and B = {3, 4} is {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n\n        - (A∩B) denotes the intersection of the two sets which are the common elements in both sets.\nFor example (A∪B) with A = {1, 2} and B = {2, 3} is {2}.\n\n        - (A-B) denotes the difference between the two sets which is a set containing all the elements from set A with any common elements with set B removed.\nFor example (A-B) with A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 4} is {1, 3}.\n\n        - A^c denotes the compliment of A which is everything from the universal set excluding elements from set A.\nFor example A^c with A = {1, 2, 3} and U = {1, 2, ..., 9, 10} is {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.\n\n        - |A| denotes the cardinality of set A which is the total number of elements included in set A.\nFor example |A| with A = {1, 2, 3, 4} is 4.\n\n        - (A⊆B) denotes that A is a subset of B meaning set A contains only elements that are also present in set B.\nFor example A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} means (A⊆B) is True.\n\n        - (A=B) denotes equality which means that sets A and B contain identical elements.\nFor example A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {1, 2, 3} means (A=B) is True.\n\n        - (A⊂B) denotes that A is a proper subset of B meaning that all of the elements of set A are present in set B but sets and B are not equal.\nFor example A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} means (A⊆B) is True. A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {1, 2, 3} means (A⊂B) is False.\n\n    Special Sets:\n        - Set N denotes the set of all natural numbers. Aslo known as counting numbers, set N is all positive integers from 0: {1, 2, 3, 4,...}.\n\n        - Set Z is the set of all integers. Similar to set N except it also includes all negative integers: {...,-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.\n\n        - Set Q is the set of all rational numbers. Rational numbers are those that can be written as ratios or fractions\nFor example those that can be defined as p/q where p, q ∈ Z, e.g. 1/3,−17/4.\n\n        - Set R is the set of all Real numbers - including all decimal numbers, for example 3/4, 42, 0.43237. This also includes all unending numbers such as π, 0.333..., √2.\n\n        - Set C is the set of all complex numbers. For example √-1."}
